Welcome to Armor Adapt and thank you for joining in this experience. This mod was built with the intention of allowing race mods to easily share clothing between each other. The added plus is that the requirement of this mod (completely optional) can even reduce the amount of items and recipes you have to make for your mod.

Granted due to Steam Workshop not notifying the userbase of mod updates, if your mod has already existed on Steam and you want to make it depend on Armor Adapt, best to do a SAIL radio message to tell users in-game.

So what does Armor Adapt Require of you?
You need to first patch your species into the config for this mod located in /scripts/armorAdapt/armorAdapt.config.

How you will patch, is already provided in templates inside this mod.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/////[Image Requirements]\\\\\
This only counts for the images inside the folder paths you will have to make for compatibility, you do not need to modify the original items to fit these requirements

Armor Adapt uses these files to apply the alternate images

Head Items:
headf.png (female)
headm.png (male)
mask.png (no change)

Chest Items:
bsleeve.png (male)
bsleevef.png (female)
chestf.png (female)
chestm.png (male)
fsleeve.png (male)
fsleevef.png (female)

Leg Items:
pantsf.png (female)
pantsm.png (male)

Back Items:
back.png (no changes)

If any frames files to fit a species with a custom humanoid config are required, add in the frames files for said images.

/////[Setting up your Species]\\\\\

[Vanilla Body Type]:
	This means that your species uses the standard vanilla body shape. Your head is around the same size; you have no top ears, horns or other head features that break the vanilla outline. Your body does not have anything that breaks the normal vanilla outline. You keep to the same arm positions.

	Your species could be easily confused with vanilla or can wear any vanilla clothing without problems. Use standardSpeciesPatch_Template.txt as your guide to patching.

	Your species will be recognized as "standard" within the script so if you are adding new items images from your race to armor adapt, your folder structure for the images will be
	/items/armors/armorAdapt/standard/<itemName>/Default/(put in your images)

	Armor adapt relies upon this specific path in order to display the correct images. <itemName> has to be the itemName specified in your (head, chest, pants, back) file as the script pulls that item name to make the path. 
	
	Ex: "itemName" : "itemName",

	If there does so happen to be another mod that gives your species a "custom body" then details on how to work compatibility will have to be discussed with the Armor Adapt Dev(s). An additional patch might be needed. Your race will no longer be considered "Vanilla Body type"

	If your mod uses color changes to alter the body of your species, you will have to discuss with the Armor Adapt Dev(s) about making compatibility for the changed look. An additional patch might be needed. Your race will no longer be considered "Vanilla Body type"

[Custom Body Type]:
	This means that the body of your species does not follow the vanilla body shape at all or barely away from it. If you have a vanilla body shape but have ears, horns, and other head body parts, then they would count as custom body type species.

	Your species will be recognized by their own species name so you will use customSpeciesPatch_Template.txt as your guide on how to patch your species into Armor Adapt.

	If your Custom Body Species has alternate looks by changing the colors in character creation to change the body or there are mods out there that change the body shape (humanoid, lamia, taur, other body changing mods); then get in contact with the Armor Adapt Dev(s) for compatibility on how to make those alternate body types.

	Alternate body types is a feature of Armor Adapt, meant to go much further than simply matching your species but also granting a much more perfect fit.

	When adding the folders to your mod to make compatibility for Armor Adapt in case of items your mod adds, your pathing will be
	/items/armors/armorAdapt/<species>/<itemName>/<bodyType>/(put in your images)

	<species> refers to the name of your species listed in your /species/<species>.species files.

	<itemName> has to be the itemName specified in your (head, chest, pants, back) file as the script pulls that item name to make the path. 

	<bodyType> is either Default if no other alternate body types exist or different folders for each of the body types. Contact the Armor Adapt Dev(s) to make compatibility to detect the different body types.

	If you have any vanilla body style outfits for items either in your clothing mod pack or your race mod that doesn't exist in vanilla, be sure to add the appropiate folders (see above) and images to the "standard" species folder so vanilla races can have your clothing/armor change it's look to fit them.
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/////[Making it Work]\\\\\

If you are wanting your items to be affected by armor adapt, you will need to add our builder into the files for the clothing/armor items (.head, .chest, .pants, .back files)
You will need to add "builder" : "/armorAdapt/armorAdaptBuilder.lua", to your items.

Granted any items that do not need to be converted:
Story NPC outfits
Invisible clothing
Developer vanities
Costumes
Costumes (turns player invisible)
or any other item you don't want touched

do not require you to add the builder. These items won't be converted if the builder isn't added to them.

This script has been made to be safely put inside your mod files without any crashes if armor adapt is not installed. In fact!! If you uninstall Armor Adapt, the items with this builder will revert to a state before Armor Adapt even touched it! HANDY!

You can grab a copy of the builder by copying the /armorAdapt/ (above the cinematics folder) folder in this mod and pasting it into yours in the same spot. This is not considered file stealing, this is part of the compatibility.

Once everything is set up, your items should start changing their looks. They are even set up to be able to pass back and forth between different species and they still adapt to the new owner.

If you don't want to make images for every item in existence, that is okay and was though of. We have fallback measures in the builder script just for this situation.

Which option you choose is up to how you want the species in your race mod to handle items that don't have alternate artwork yet.

[Using Default Images]

	Make the folder path /items/armors/armorAdapt/default/<species>/<bodyType>
	
	<species> is the internal name of the species talked about above
	
	<bodyType> is either Default or multiple folders named after all of the different body types for the species.
	
	Leave these folders empty and Armor Adapt will use the item's original images if alternate artwork doesn't exist for your species.

[Using Species Default Outfit]

	Make the folder path /items/armors/armorAdapt/default/<species>
	
	<species> as stated before is the species internal name
	
	That is the first folder required. In this folder, you want to place a set of images for all of the different sprite sheets: head, chest, pants, and back would call for. This is your fallback measure if there do not exist default images for the different body types. Say a new body type is added to Armor Adapt for your species without images for them in most cases.

	After this, inside this folder you need to make more. Make a folder for every body type your species has and name them according with the names you worked out with the Armor Adapt Dev(s). If you do not have multiple body types, then you'll only need a "Default" folder.

	Inside these folder(s) will contain all of the possible images needed for any type (head, chest, pants, back) for the bodyTypes you need. These will be the defaults that fit the species perfectly if they have different body types or if only Default, the perfect fit for your one body type.
	
	Although as a note, back.png is not entirely required. If you include a back.png, it'll override the appearance of any back item that doesn't have alternate artwork for your species. So if you leave it out, the back item will use the item's original images instead. Back items usually have no differences whatsoever between species so in most cases you do not need a default for them. In most cases, the only reason to have default images for back items is for species that are not humanoid or more animal shaped. The defaults are normally used to change the back item to fit the non-humanoid race or to hide back items entirely by default.

	These are your fallback images in case images are not made for something yet. Choose images that work together as a full outfit that you wouldn't mind seeing, these may be seen a lot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/////[Transforming Effects]\\\\\
_______WARNING ADVANCED_________

Armor Adapt does provide a system for further utility. This being the use of status effects to alter the image paths Armor Adapt uses. This can be used for several things ranging from forcible changing sprites or even disguises. The different kinds goes as follows.

Although do note, this cannot be used to animate armors.

[Body Type Effects]
	These effects change <bodyType> to alter what images will be used. Although it does not override <bodyType> entirely, instead it adds the name of the effect onto the end of the body type name.

	So say humans count as standard with a body type of Default

	If you have a status effect named "super" for example, making the effect active would change the image paths to this

	/items/armors/armorAdapt/standard/<itemName>/Defaultsuper/(images) (for specific item)
	/items/armors/armorAdapt/default/standard/Defaultsuper/(images) (for default species images)

	Since the bodyType is the same, just with "super" added to the end, it can call upon different images that still consider the different body types if set up.

	Although you will notice that in case of default fallback, you cannot set default images for if a body type is missing.

	This would mostly be used for armors that have different forms or modes that the status effect would change them into. At least in the early brainstorming, this is what it would be thought to be used for.
	For this, you would use transformationStatusPatch_Template.txt for how to patch your status effect in and transformativeStatusScript_Template.txt for how to set up the status effect to trigger the image change.
	
[Species Effects]
	These effects change <species> to add the effect name onto the end but doesn't override <species> entirely.
	
	using previous example, but using "type2" as the status effect name this time, the alternate paths would go as follows
	
	/items/armors/armorAdapt/standardtype2/<itemName>/Default/(images) (for specific item)
	/items/armors/armorAdapt/default/standardtype2/Default/(images) (for default species)
	
	As you can see this would make Armor Adapt think an entirely new species exists, and as such you may think that setting up the folder path for specific items would be redundant for what you want to do. In this case, it would mostly be, and you probably would be using this status effect for the default species images on purpose. Although unlike the previous type of effectm you do notice that you can set default images for the custom species if the body types don't exist. It will also consider the body types of the base species the status effect altered. So this allows the status effect to make default images an additional level in case some body types are missing.
	
	This would mostly be used, in theory, with forcing a particular outfit onto an entity. Although you may notice that it seems pretty interchangable with the previous effect type. Although the difference in changing <species> instead of <bodyType> does have enough pros and cons to make both options viable.
	
	For this, you would use speciesStringStatusPatch_Template.txt for how to patch your status effect in and use transformativeStatusScript_Template.txt on how to set up the status effect to trigger the image changes.
	
[Override Effects]
	These effects override both <species> and <bodyType> entirely, not considering species and body type. As well it also applies "hideBody" : true to pants items to make the entity invisible
	
	Using the previous example but, "dogEffect" as the status effect name, the alternate paths would go as follows
	
	/items/armors/armorAdapt/dogEffect/<itemName>/Default/(images) (for specific item)
	/items/armors/armorAdapt/default/dogEffect/Default/(images) (for default species)
	
	As you can notice, <bodyType> also gets changed to "Default". This effect is almost entirely meant for fallback images instead of alt images for items. This effect is used to force a disguise or costume onto the entity. This can be used for many things, but mostly for hiding the player to force a particular sprite sheet. This would allow temporary disguises applied via status effect that keeps the stat boosts of the current equipped items.
	
	For this, you would use overrideStatusPatch_Template.txt for how to patch your status effect in. You would use transformativeStatusScript_Template.txt on how to make the status effect trigger the image changes.

/////[Closing]\\\\\

Hopefully this document has given you enough info to understand how Armor Adapt works and how to make compatibility. The many templates provided will hopefully make things far easier. A wiki on the github page will be in the works eventually. Although if info is missing or clarification is needed, reach out to one of the Armor Adapt Dev(s).
